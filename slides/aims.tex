          Exploration of defect centres using state-of-the-art \textcolor{red}{ab-initio}
          theories.

        \item
          Systematic characterization of defect fingerprints.

        \item
          Search for new defects with tailored properties which are useful
          for different applications.

        \item
          Benchmark ab-initio theories with well-known
          experimental data.

  \note{

    So the main aim of this work is to computationally
    treat electronic properties of defect centers in diamond
    using state-of-the-art ab initio theories.

    Through this exploration we hope to recover many well-known
    experimentally verified quantities.

    In order to do this we use several purely theoretical
    results to orient our calculations into the right direction.
