  \note{%

    Another important aim of our project is to calculate
    correctly the zero field splitting of the energy levels.

    In this case we are interested in the splitting that
    arises from the Spin-Spin interaction of the electrons.
    This splits into up to three levels the triplet state.
    This splitting is characterized by two parameters,
    $ E $  and $ D $.

    The splitting also arises through strain of the material
    and Zeeman splitting.
